                                <p>durian is an open source client-server networking library built on top of the QUIC protocol which is implemented in Rust by quinn.</p>
                                <p>It provides a thin abstraction layer above the lower-level details of connection management, byte management, framing, and more, to make writing netcode easier and allow the user to focus on the messaging contents instead. Serialization and deserialization are built into the APIs so you can send and receive exact Packets as structs for ease of development.</p>
                                <p>durian is a general purpose library, but was made primarily for me to dabble in game development. It has been tested and working with the Bevy game engine.</p>

                                <p>Mobs have a chance to spawn marked with a Bounty!   A marked Bounty mob will have special effects, sizes, stats, and will bountifully reward the player with fully configurable loot drops, and bonus stats upon bounty hunter level ups, enhancing the combat experience.</p>
                                <p>The vision for this mod is to upgrade the experience when fighting mobs and give incentive for exploring to find these special Bounty mobs and hunt them down.  This can enhance existing mob hunting systems, or players can grind to become a full fledged Bounty Hunter.</p>

                                <p>SpoornPacks is an API Library mod for the Minecraft Fabric mod loader that adds simple-to-use APIs for automagically generating resource asset and data files, and injects them into the game as a mock Resource Pack. This allows mod creators to create their resources entirely in code with very succinct APIs, while still allowing overriding via your own Resource files.</p>
                                <p>The goal of this mod is to simplify resource creation (i.e. blocks, items, structures, features, etc.) as much as possible for the majority of use cases, while being extensible to more complex ones.  The typical process for adding a block or item involves several Json files with oftentimes rather cryptic contents, and injecting into various Minecraft registries, methods, classes, etc.  This API Library removes all that overhead for the mod creator and turns it into a single one-line Java call, simple datagen</p>

                                <p>This mod adds unique weapons/armor/tools or loot in general that may have semi-randomized attributes to encourage exploration and adventuring in your world for the chance to find legendary items.  Loot has a chance to spawn in all loot chests.  Weapons can be dual-wielded to promote maxing out attributes and enchantments for both hand weapons.  Items also have different textures and sounds.  Try right clicking with some of them or hitting different things!  Eventually, the items should scale with the player's achievements/difficulty and world.</p>

                                <p>durian is an open source client-server networking library built on top of the QUIC protocol which is implemented in Rust by quinn.</p>
                                <p>It provides a thin abstraction layer above the lower-level details of connection management, byte management, framing, and more, to make writing netcode easier and allow the user to focus on the messaging contents instead. Serialization and deserialization are built into the APIs so you can send and receive exact Packets as structs for ease of development.</p>
                                <p>durian is a general purpose library, but was made primarily for me to dabble in game development. It has been tested and working with the Bevy game engine.</p>
